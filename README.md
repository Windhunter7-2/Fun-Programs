# Fun-Programs

These are for the unofficial programs made exclusively by me, just for random fun reasons, and are not part of my official programs

~ Windhunter7

Here is the list of what each program does:

- 40K_ListRandomizer -> For my particular Astra Militarum codex in the Games Workshop game Warhammer 40K, using my particular models, construct randomized, but mathematically balanced, army lists, of inputted points value and of inputted numbers of these lists, outputting them to a file
- 40K_ListRandomizer_Template -> A template, based off my own (But without some of the extra features for certain units; see 40K_ListRandomizer for these extra features) list randomizer, that you can use to create your own army lists; keep in mind that you can in fact have several units be considered as a "grouped" unit, very easily, via modifying the "add_ExampleUnit()" method
